# SNHU_CS330_Project
Simulated 3D scene written using C++ and OpenGL and implementing the Phong shading model, based on a real-life photo.

## How do I approach designing software?
Normally, I like to avoid hard-coding any data into software that I write. However, I found myself frequently doing this when developing this scene because I was unfamiliar with OpenGL and its use cases. That said, as I got more familiar over the course term, I altered the application code to increasingly parameterize the data being used and modularize the functions being called as to make it generally more 'dynamic'. Parameterized and modularized code is highly efficient and dramatically reduces the complexity of finding and fixing errors as well as implementing new functionality. From a design perspective, the process of creating this scene was significantly less structured than normal because I was, let's just say, "going in blind".

## How do I approach developing software?
My process of developing this scene was somewhat similar in nature to my design process, where it was not as structured as I'd like it to be. Under normal circumstances, I will create general design specifications first (though the quality and specificity will vary based on the software being developed) and *then* begin development based on those specifications or design documents. In this case, however, the software's development followed a sort of 'learn as you go' process for me as I advanced from having zero knowledge of OpenGL to having enough knowledge to implement the Phong shading model.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
In the simplest sense, my main goal is to acquire my Bachelor's Degree and move onto a job in the field of software development. I have numerous reasons for desiring this, but they mostly boil down to two main points: 1) I am passionate about software development, and 2) there is significant financial incentive to get into the field. That said, my first reason carries *much* more weight than the second; I did not pursue computer science for the money but rather for the passion I have for it. I design and develop software in my free time, mostly video games, and I would like to translate this passion into a career.
